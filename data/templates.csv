- Search for the corresponding campaign in Salesforce
- If the campaign does not exist, create a new campaign in Salesforce and send a mail
- Search for the contact in Salesforce
- If the contact does not exist, create a new contact in Salesforce
- Search for the campaign again to fetch the current campaign
- Add the contact as a campaign member to the campaign we created

- Invoices in Infusionsoft MUST contain the relevant Xero Invoice ID in the invoice Job Title field.
- If the Xero Invoice was created by Workato, it will contain Infusionsoft InvoiceID in it's Reference field. It will be used for matching with Infusionsoft invoices as well.

workato,Sync Replicon clients and projects into Concur,"This recipe transfers active Replicon clients and their associated projects (for projects with statuses In Progress, Deferred and Tentative) into Concur as a 2-level linked list. 
For projects without a client, the integration creates a first level list object called `Internal` in Concur and creates the projects under that list item.

#### How it works

Trigger: Paid expense reports 

Actions:
- If Replicon project status is Cancelled, Completed or Archived, end recipe.
- Get details of the client associated to the project. If client is inactive, end recipe. If client is active and does not exist in Concur yet, create client. If client is active and exists in Concur, go to next step. If not client exists, create the list item `Internal` if it does not already exist in Concur.
- Search for the second-level project list item in Concur. If does not exist, create it. If it exists in Concur already, do nothing.

#### Customization Options
- Set your own criteria to filter what specific Replicon clients and projects you would like to sync across to Concur
- Set your own linked list levels (this recipe uses a 2-level linked list)
- Give your linked list a unique name

#### What you need to use this recipe
- You should have a Replicon account with integrations rights and the Project Administrator and Client Manager permission set (view and edit all clients, programs, projects and project teams in Replicon), as well as a Concur account with the following access rights: Can Administer, Can Submit, Approve and Process Expense Reports.
- You should have a 2-level linked list created in Concur with the linked list name being equal to the linked list name in the recipe

#### How it works

Trigger: Recipe picks up paid expense reports (reimbursed expense reports which have been approved and processed) in Concur from one day ago at the start of the recipe.

Actions:
- Create an expense sheet in Replicon with the Replicon expense sheet owner as the Concur expense submitter.
- Expense line items in Concur are broken down into itemised expenses (if itemized), and itemized expenses are broken down by allocations (if allocated). We iterate through the list of expense entries list, itemisation list and allocations list to bring the itemised and allocated expenses across to Replicon as a single line item (i.e. 1 expense line that has 2 itemisations and 2 allocations will be brought over as 4 line items in Replicon).
- Expenses will be brought over from Concur to Replicon in the reimbursement currency of the expense sheet submitter (the reimbursement currency of the submitter in Concur should correspond to a default currency in Replicon - US Dollar, Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japense Yen, Swiss Franc)
- Replicon receives the expenses and converts the currency into the base currency of the Replicon account if the base currency of the Replicon account is not equal to the reimbursement currency of the expense sheet submitter

workato,Create Google Form URL for GUIDEcx project,"Click ""Configuration Parameters"" at the bottom of this recipe to configure the recipe settings.

This recipe takes as input a Calendly event URL and creates a project-specific URL, and populates that URL into a GUIDEcx custom merge-tag on the project. That custom merge-tag can then be used in a task description. In this way your GUIDEcx template can simply use the custom merge-tag in a task description, and on each project the URL will be automatically filled in.

The ""Special Phrase"" setting in the Configuration Parameters must be the same in this recipe and the corresponding Calendly invite processing recipe. This setting accomplishes two goals:
1) Allows you to use the same Calendly event URL for both GUIDEcx projects and non-GUIDEcx meetings
2) Allows you to use the same Calendly event URL multiple times in the same GUIDEcx project. To do so clone this recipe (and the corresponding Calendly invite processing recipe). For example, say you have a Calendly event URL in your Calendly account named ""30 Minute Meeting"". You want to use it in GUIDEcx projects for both a kickoff call and a go-live prep call. Clone the two recipes. Then in the first pair of recipes define a special phrase like ""kickoff"", and in the second pair of recipes define a special phrase like ""go-live-prep"" (avoid spaces).

When an employee is hired, the first step is to update the offer status and create an onboarding task for the HR department. This ensures that HR is aware of the new hire and can start the onboarding process promptly.

Once the onboarding task has been created, the next step is to retrieve the onboarding form. This form contains all the necessary information about the new employee, including their personal details, job title, and employment status. This information is used to create the employee profile, which is essential for managing the employee's benefits, payroll, and other HR-related tasks.

https://help.guidecx.com/en/articles/8003028-calendly-create-calendar-url-for-project-recipe

Click ""Configuration Parameters"" at the bottom of this recipe to configure the recipe settings.

This recipe takes as input a Calendly event URL and creates a project-specific URL, and populates that URL into a GUIDEcx custom merge-tag on the project. That custom merge-tag can then be used in a task description. In this way your GUIDEcx template can simply use the custom merge-tag in a task description, and on each project the URL will be automatically filled in.

The ""Special Phrase"" setting in the Configuration Parameters must be the same in this recipe and the corresponding Calendly invite processing recipe. This setting accomplishes two goals:
1) Allows you to use the same Calendly event URL for both GUIDEcx projects and non-GUIDEcx meetings
2) Allows you to use the same Calendly event URL multiple times in the same GUIDEcx project. To do so clone this recipe (and the corresponding Calendly invite processing recipe). For example, say you have a Calendly event URL in your Calendly account named ""30 Minute Meeting"". You want to use it in GUIDEcx projects for both a kickoff call and a go-live prep call. Clone the two recipes. Then in the first pair of recipes define a special phrase like ""kickoff"", and in the second pair of recipes define a special phrase like ""go-live-prep"" (avoid spaces). You'll also need two GUIDEcx custom merge-tags, one for the kickoff call URL and one for the go-live prep URL.",570134,,1,"[""guid_ecx_connector_570134_1674144649"",""py_eval"",""custom:guidecx""]"

workato,Updated Invoice in QuickBooks Online will update invoice status in Replicon,"This recipe syncs the QuickBooks invoice status back into the corresponding Replicon invoice. When the QuickBooks status changes to 'Open (sent)' or 'Paid', the invoice status in Replicon will be correspondingly changed to 'Billed' and 'Paid' respectively. This is useful when Replicon is your project management system that consolidates timesheets and expenses in a central system, while QuickBooks Online is your accounting system.

Also, this recipe keeps the due date of the invoices in sync - updated due dates on QuickBooks invoices will update the due date on Replicon invoices correspondingly.


#### How it works

Trigger: Invoices updated since a day ago in QuickBooks will be picked up at the start of the recipe. Subsequently, updated invoices will continue to be picked up by the recipe.

Actions:
- Update due date of Replicon invoice if it has been changed in QuickBooks.
- If QuickBooks' email status is equal to 'EmailSent' and the outstanding balance is more than 0, then set the Replicon invoice status as Billed. If QuickBooks' email status is equal to 'EmailSent' and the outstanding balance is 0, then set the Replicon invoice status as Paid.


#### Customization Options
- NIL


#### What you need to use this recipe
- You should have a Replicon account with integrations rights and the Billing Manager permission set, as well as a Quickbooks Online account with Company Administrator rights.
- Invoices that has been previously synced over from Replicon. The QuickBooks invoice should have the Replicon invoice URI stored in its statement memo field.

Usually used with: 
If QuickBooks is master system for client data:
- Sync new invoice in Replicon to QuickBooks Online - QuickBooks is master system 
- Sync QuickBooks Online customers to Replicon

If Replicon is master system for client data:
- Sync new invoice in Replicon to QuickBooks Online - Replicon is master system",56,,878,"[""quickbooks"",""replicon""]"
workato,Deprecated - Sync new invoice in Replicon to QuickBooks Online - QuickBooks is master system,"- This recipe transfers new invoices from Replicon to QuickBooks Online
- If the customer does not exist in QuickBooks, the job will fail and the invoice will not be synced over to QuickBooks. This is because QuickBooks is the master for customers
- This is useful when Replicon is your timesheet management system that consolidates timesheets and expenses in a central system, while QuickBooks Online is your accounting system.

#### How it works

Trigger:  Invoices with the Sync Status marked as `Queued for Sync` in Replicon will be picked up and processed by the recipe.

Actions:
- Get details of the Replicon invoice line items. These come in 3 different lists: 1 list each for time, fixed bids and expenses.
- In QuickBooks, search for the customer the invoice is billed to. If the customer does not currently exist in QuickBooks, the job will fail and the invoice will not be synced over to QuickBooks.
- Create the invoice header in QuickBooks with the first invoice line item.
- For each of the lists of time, fixed bids and expenses, iterate through the lists to bring invoice line items from Replicon into the QuickBooks invoice.
- Finally, return to Replicon to update the invoice's External ID field with the corresponding QuickBooks invoice number, update the invoice due date with the automatically calculated due date from QuickBooks (assuming the net terms for the client has been set correctly in QuickBooks), and change the Sync Status to `Synced`. 

#### Customization Options
- If QuickBooks is not the master system for client data and Replicon is instead the master system, you can choose to create customers in QuickBooks if they don`t already exist in QuickBooks. Refer to an alternative recipe: Sync new invoice in Replicon to QuickBooks Online - Replicon is master system.
- You can customise the description of the invoice line items when they get synced in QuickBooks and the Item Name they are mapped to in the actions `Add line item to invoice in QuickBooks`

#### What you need to use this recipe
- You should have a Replicon account with integrations rights and the Billing Manager permission set, as well as a Quickbooks Online account with Company Administrator rights. For the actions to add line items to QuickBooks, the Item name must be the name of an Inventory item in your QuickBooks account.

- You should have a Replicon account with integrations rights and the Billing Manager permission set, as well as a Xero account with, minimally, ‘Standard’ permission set and the permissions to read/write invoices.
Invoices that has been previously synced over from Replicon using a Workato recipe. If so, this recipe will be able to identify the Xero invoice and match it to its corresponding Replicon invoice. If the invoice has been synced in any way apart from a Workato recipe previously, but you have migrated to using a Workato recipe, you would have to manually update these previously synced invoices. If you will be consistently using a different integration to sync your invoices from Replicon to Xero and you are storing the Replicon URI on the Xero invoice (as an ID to match the 2 invoices on Replicon and Xero), you will have to edit the recipe to replace the datapill in the ‘Invoice URI’ input fields of Replicon actions to the Xero invoice datapill you are storing the Replicon URI in.


Usually used with: 
If Xero is master system for client data:
- Sync new invoice in Replicon to Xero - Xero is master system 
- Sync Xero ‘Paid’ invoice status to Replicon
- Sync Xero customers to Replicon

If Replicon is master system for client data:
- Sync new invoice in Replicon to Xero - Replicon is master system
- Sync Xero ‘Paid’ invoice status to Replicon
- Sync Replicon customers to Xero",56,,858,"[""xero"",""replicon""]"
