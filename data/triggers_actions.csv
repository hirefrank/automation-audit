This call assumes that the rider has a bicycle at the 'start' point, and provides a biking route from there to the 'end' point if both are within Citymapper's supported areas. The resulting route should contain a single bike leg, though the 'path_annotations' property of the leg may indicate sections during which the user should walk beside the bike. This call does not incorporate any information about bike operators' coverage or parking areas, but other service calls may be available to do so. The maximum great-circle distance between the start and end is limited to 200km for this service."

The resulting route provides enough information to render it on a map, along with a duration estimate. This call can be used in several different ways: Use any bike of the specified Brand This is the simplest call, only requiring 'start', 'end', and 'brand_id'. Citymapper assumes that the user is at the 'start' point, and chooses a bike of the specified Brand, if possible. Use a bike at a specified location By adding 'original_vehicle_location' to 'start', 'end', and 'brand_id', Citymapper plans a route that assumes the bike is at the given location. Update a route in progress In order to retrieve an updated route that includes rerouting from the user's current location if they've diverged from the planned Route, the caller can add the 'current_location' and 'ride_state' properties, which indicates which leg of the resulting route should be rerouted around the user's 'current_location'."

The resulting route provides enough information to render it on a map, along with a duration estimate. (These results are optimized for larger internal combustion or electric scooters where the rider is seated.) NOTE: The resulting route currently assumes that the user can ride directly to the specified 'end' location, not taking into account any parking or coverage zones. Thus, the resulting route will contain only an initial leg of 'travel_mode' 'walk' and a second leg of 'travel_mode' 'self_piloted'. A future update will incorporate parking and coverage zones and add a final 'walk' leg. This call can be used in several different ways: Use any scooter of the specified Brand This is the simplest call, only requiring 'start', 'end', and 'brand_id'.

citymapper,citymapper,power-automate,,1,Citymapper (Independent Publisher) (Preview) (Premium),steps,Get a taxi route between two points,"Gets a taxi route between two points. The resulting route provides enough information to render it on a map, along with a duration estimate. The route may contain starting and ending walk legs if the pick-up or drop-off points aren't close to the requested start and end coordinates. The Services in the response will vary depending on the local availability, time of day and, additionally, which Taxi service integrations have been configured for your account. There are two recommended ways to use this service: You can request a taxi route with live on-demand service estimates included up-front by calling with '?fetch_on_demand_services=true'; or you can make the initial request without fetching estimates which will respond with the non-live route, then immediately call '1/live/routeupdates' to get the additional live estimates. The first approach is simpler, but the second may better fit your use-case."

Walking routes are expected to have a single leg with a 'travel_mode' of 'walk'. If Citymapper can't compute walking directions for those points (generally for coverage reasons), the service will return a code '400' response.

The resulting route should contain a single scooter leg, though the 'path_annotations' property of the leg may indicate sections during which the user should walk beside the scooter. This call does not incorporate any information about scooter operators' coverage or parking areas, but other service calls may be available to do so. Successful responses (HTTP code '200') will consume one 'Scooter Route' credit (or one 'Scooter Reroute' credit if 'reroute_signature' is used) for each HTTP response.

exact time & billing,exact time & billing,power-automate,,1,Exact Time & Billing (Independent Publisher) (Preview) (Premium),steps,Get project time cost transactions,"The TimeCostTransactions sync api returns both time and cost transactions. To filter out time or cost transactions you need to filter only on property Type. The API does not allow to filter on these fields. Filtering need to be done after receiving the records. The sync api's have the goal to keep the data between Exact Online and a 3rd party application the same. The sync api's are all based on row versioning and because of that it is guaranteed to be unique. Every time an existing record is changed or a new record is inserted, the row versioning value is higher than the highest available value at that time. When retrieving records via these api's also a timestamp value is returned. The highest timestamp value of the records returned should be stored on client side. Next time records are retrieved, the timestamp value stored on client side should be provided as parameter. The api will then return only the new and changed records. Using this method is more reliable than using modified date, since it can happen that multiple records have the same modified date and therefore same record can be returned more than once. This will not happen when using timestamp. The sync api's are also developed to give best performance when retrieving records. Because of performance and the intended purpose of the api's, only the timestamp field is allowed as parameter. The single and bulk api’s are designed for a different purpose. They provide ability to retrieve specific record or a set of records which meet certain conditions. In case the division is moved to another database in Exact Online the timestamp values will be reset. Therefore, after a division is moved all data needs to be synchronized again in order to get the new timestamp values. To see if a division was moved, the /api/v1/{division}/system/Divisions can be used. The property DivisionMoveDate indicated at which date a division was moved and this date can be used to determine if it is needed to synchronize all data again. The API has two important key fields, the Timestamp and the ID. The ID should be used to uniquely identify the record and will never change. The Timestamp is used to get new or changed records in an efficient way and will change for every change made to the record. The timestamp value returned has no relation with actual date or time. As such it cannot be converted to a date\time value. The timestamp is a rowversion value. When you use the sync or delete api for the first time for a particular division, filter on timestamp greater than 1."

Returned file metadata includes both the originally supplied filename and the possibly modified name that Acclaro will use. Individual file size is limited to 100MB maximum . The API is file agnostic, as there are no file type limitations. XLIFF files are a common translation industry standard and are fully supported. In-progress orders may have new additional files added to them as long as the source and target languages match the original order’s files. For continuous programmatic orders, it is recommended that the /orders/{orderid}/files be used to build orders up with source files before submission via the SubmitOrder call, as this is the most efficient path for Acclaro translation services to receive orders with multiple files and then return subsequent translation files.
